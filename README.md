# DiPlay

**CarPlay for compatible BYD Android head units.** Wired and wireless, with the familiar DiAuto interface. Independent app: `com.shihab.diplay`.

> **BYD support scope:** These projects focus on BYD cars. They may work on other brands, but other brands are unsupported and there are no plans to add support or fix brand-specific incompatibilities.

## 0.2.12 — public preview

Install on the **car**, not the iPhone. No jailbreak, dongle, Mac, account or authentication server is required for use. Core CarPlay does not require ADB; optional dashboard, battery, wheel-speed and parked-video features do. Your head unit must permit APK installation. Wireless supports Wi-Fi Direct, the car’s existing hotspot or Existing Wi-Fi / Same LAN; Wi-Fi Direct requires Android 10+; the APK supports Android 9+ for wired use.

- Wired USB and wireless CarPlay with local authentication.
- BYD HUD navigation with arrows, distance and street names on verified firmware.
- Car hotspot support, improved audio buffering and saved receive diagnostics.
- Automatic address discovery, fixed-channel Wi-Fi fallbacks and successful-configuration memory.
- Icon/text size, resolution and frame rate; applying a display change reconnects CarPlay.
- Local diagnostic export. Reports are sent only if you choose to share them.
- Separate installation alongside DiAuto. Run one projection app at a time.

This is **not an Apple-certified product**. The APK bundles an experimental accessory identity recovered from public Carlinkit firmware, not a newly provisioned MFi identity for DiPlay. A bundled private key is extractable. Acceptance after future iOS updates, reliability across head units and suitability of that identity for general distribution are unresolved. This release invites community testing; it is not a guarantee of universal compatibility.

Earlier releases were tested on the development DiLink5.1 car: live windshield guidance and street names work, Car hotspot now starts CarPlay, and Wi-Fi Direct performance is substantially improved. Occasional audio cutouts remain and are deferred to a later update. The floating-map test build was installed on the development DiLink 5.1 car; feedback led to the pinch corrections in 0.2.9. Earlier wheel-speed and video contributions were tested on a BYD Tang with DiLink 5.0 and an iPhone 15 Pro on iOS 27; wheel-speed dead reckoning in tunnels remains unverified. Broader head-unit and iOS compatibility is not guaranteed. The HUD firmware scope and cleanup limits are documented in [BYD navigation](docs/BYD_NAVIGATION.md).

## What’s new in 0.2.12

- Add Existing Wi-Fi / Same LAN wireless CarPlay with scoped IPv4/IPv6 discovery and network-change cleanup (#223).
- Wait for a stable car-hotspot interface and recover bounded wireless attempts when no AirPlay TCP follows StartSession (#229); add observed-state, authorized-ADB hotspot fallback on firmware exposing supported commands (#235).
- Improve Apple USB attach matching and narrowly scoped optional USB-prompt assistance (#170, #224).
- Pause Android 10 station scans during eligible hotspot/P2P sessions, preserving Same LAN, with controller leases and durable retryable restoration (#225).
- Improve split-screen, launcher cards, short-screen preparation and virtual cluster/floating-map geometry (#171, #172, #181).
- Add independent system-bar controls and correct in-session save/cancel and Local/USB-CH341 authentication selection (#191, #194).
- Add system, light-sensor, day and night CarPlay appearance modes, richer custom turn cards, and live main-video picture controls (#178, #193, #211).
- Offer custom integer resolution from 30% to 160%, with shared limits, correct 30%/160% labels and decoder/canvas capability fallback; refresh connection settings on resume (#179, #230, #196).
- Reconcile opt-in DiLink 4 cluster routing/calibration into one decoder owner, retain verified HUD gates, and journal exact stock-map holds and recovery (#213, #187).
- Add DiLink 3 guidance text and projection-display support with committed recovery before mutation, partial-setup compensation and retryable stock restoration (#182).
- Add opt-in wheel map zoom and main-screen joystick while preserving press/release and call behavior; reject stale queued work across phone/screen changes (#214, #231).
- Switch supported dashboard contents live using actual delivery and safely retained paused choices; preserve selection across stream/phone replacement (#232).
- Add a five-second dashboard-song-on-change window with timer invalidation, and retain album art while the next transfer is pending (#215, #228).
- Export reports through Downloads, document picker, app-external or private fallback storage, with explicit View/Share actions (#185, #219).

See [0.2.12 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.12.md) and [validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) for the full reviewed changes, contributor evidence and remaining hardware checks. Higher resolution costs more decoder/GPU work; above 100% is not a recommended default. Supported firmware and authorization are still required for optional BYD paths. General stutter, calls/Siri, iOS 15 startup and model-specific reports remain under investigation.

If a problem remains, reproduce it on **0.2.12**, then use **Settings → Diagnostics → Save diagnostic report**. Android 10+ normally saves to **Downloads/DiPlay**; Android 9 uses the document picker. If unavailable, use **View report** or **Share** from the confirmation, which identifies external/private fallback storage. Review the `.txt` and add it to a matching [existing issue](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay/issues), or [create one](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay/issues/new/choose). Include vehicle/head-unit model, exact firmware and Android/DiLink, phone/iOS, connection backend, relevant settings, steps and failure time. Reports are shared only when you choose; never post your hotspot password.

## Documentation

[Existing Wi-Fi / Same LAN](docs/EXISTING_WIFI.md) keeps the iPhone and head unit
on an external router. See the guide for setup, build requirements and the
BYD DiLink 4.0 / Android 10 clean-install validation result.

The home/settings UI and website adapt [DiAuto](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiAuto), AGPL-3.0; that license is included in `docs/licenses`.

This repository starts with a clean public source snapshot. Local research, tester reports and release-signing secrets are excluded. The complete source corresponding to the APK is provided with every release; experimental runtime identity assets are described separately in the build instructions and notices.

## Local release packaging

The release APK intentionally contains the experimental accessory identity. The Git repository and source archive exclude all accessory and Android signing keys; tests generate synthetic identities at runtime. Source/CI builds omit runtime identity assets by default. Local release builds explicitly select an external asset directory. Publishing the APK makes its bundled identity extractable; building locally does not preserve that identity's confidentiality.
